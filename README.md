In this example:
We connect to an Excel data source.
We transform the data by changing column types and filtering rows where the value in "Column2" is greater than 100.
We create a summary table by grouping the data by "Column1" and calculating the total sum of "Column2" for each category.
We sort the summarized data in descending order based on the "Total" column.
